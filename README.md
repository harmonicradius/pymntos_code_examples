frydifference.py	-- compute the difference between two images, open the result
histograms.py	- generate histograms of images 
image_compare.py	-- compare two images, and get a numerical estimate for the difference
presentation.pdf	-- a couple of slides that I used
requests_example.py -- a more complicated requests example. this is a precursor for (https://github.com/harmonicradius/diyScgApi)


If you receive errors, you may need to "pip install" some repositories:

pip install requests

pip install pil

possibly: pip install Pillow
