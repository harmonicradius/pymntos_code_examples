# pymntos_code_examples
These were scripts that I used as part of a presentation for PyMNtos. If you download the whole repository, they should run without issue.


__basicrequest.py__	-- start here to see how BeautifulSoup works and learn about making requests.

__frydifference.py__	-- compute the difference between two images, open the result

__histograms.py__	- generate histograms of images 

__image_compare.py__	-- compare two images, and get a numerical estimate for the difference

__presentation.pdf__	-- a couple of slides that I used

__requests_example.py__ -- a more complicated requests example. this is a precursor for (https://github.com/harmonicradius/diyScgApi)


If you receive errors, you may need to "pip install" some repositories:

pip install beautifulsoup4

pip install requests

pip install pil

possibly: pip install Pillow
